# RoboticArm


############################################## TODO ################################################
We have decided to redesign the arm and utilize stepper motors in place of servos to give our arm more
power. In order to redesign the arm for this purpose, we need to accomplish a few things first. Included
is a brief checklist that we can get started on to make some progress in the right direction.
  1. Ensure that the current steppers we have are powerful enough to do what we intend to
     do at the current maximum arm length
  2. Find and size proper belt and belt fixtures for the steppers
  3. Redesign the build-plate to accommodate the new motors and mount them securely
  4. Be able to build a circuit that gets the steppers to work with a joystick and maintain the
     position of our choosing when the joystick is released
  5. Ensure the steppers have operational angles that do not break the arm (they don’t need
     to spin the arm 360 degrees, more like 170ish I was thinking)
  6. Weigh the arm segments separately and use these weights in the calculation for the
     needed strength of the steppers (add 200 grams for simulated max load)
  7. Redesign arm segments to accommodate for becoming belt driven
  8. Make new concept drawings to base CAD models off of

So the first thing I think we should do of course is the concept drawings. I can mock some up eventually
but wanna see some ideas from you guys! Then, I need to get the arm disassembled and weigh the parts
individually, even though we are redesigning them. This will give us a ballpark answer to how much each
segment will weigh and we can go from there. I was planning on doing some more Solidworks designing
for the arms once I knew what motors we were going to select.

Basically, let’s get going and do what we can! If you want to do anything in particular please reach out in
the discord and let us know so we don’t end up doing it too!
